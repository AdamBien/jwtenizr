# JWTenizr

jwtenizr creates tokens and ready to use microprofile configuration. 

## installation

Download the executable and self-contained [jwtenizr.jar](https://github.com/AdamBien/jwtenizr/releases) and execute:
`java -jar jwtenizr.jar`

## usage

### initial run

`java -jar jwtenizr.jar` creates:

-`jwtenizr-config.json` with public, private key and target folder of `microprofile-config.properties`. 
- `jwt-token.json`:, with [Minimum MP-JWT Required Claims](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/september/article2.php), a sample principal and a few groups
- `token.jwt`: contains information loaded from: `jwt-token.json` and can be used as input for automated  system tests
- `microprofile-config.properties` comprising the public key an the issuer: copy to your `WAR/src/main/resources/META-INF`. 
- `curl` command: already contains the `Authorization` header with the encoded JW token:

```curl -i -H'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWÂ¢...(generated JWT token)' http://localhost:8080[RESOURCE and SUB-RESOURCES]```

### customizations

- Adjust the `groups[]` to configure roles and `upn` to change the principal in `jwt-token.json` then re-execute JWTenizr
- Add additional claims to: `jwt-token.json`

Note: The iss in `jwt-token.json` has to correspond with the `mp.jwt.verify.issuer` in `microprofile-config.properties`

## run from anywhere

```shell
#!/bin/bash
BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)
java -jar ${BASEDIR}/jwtenizr.jar "$@"%
```
