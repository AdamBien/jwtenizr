# JWTenizr

jwtenizr creates tokens and ready to use microprofile configuration. 

## installation

Download the executable and self-contained [jwtenizr.jar](https://github.com/AdamBien/jwtenizr/releases) and execute:
`java -jar jwtenizr.jar`

## usage

### initial run

`java -jar jwtenizr.jar` creates:

- Reusable, default `jwtenizr-config.json` with public, private key and target folder of `microprofile-config.properties`
- A default token configuration / template: `jwt-token.json`, which already contains the [Minimum MP-JWT Required Claims](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/september/article2.php), a sample principal and a few groups
- The generated token `token.jwt` contains information loaded from: `jwt-token.json` and can be used as input for automated  system tests
- Copy the generated `microprofile-config.properties` to your `WAR/src/main/resources/META-INF`
- A `curl` command already contains the `Authorization` header with the encoded JW token:

```curl -i -H'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWÂ¢...(generated JWT token)' http://localhost:8080[RESOURCE and SUB-RESOURCES]```

### customizations

- Adjust the `groups[]` to configure roles and `upn` to change the principal in `jwt-token.json` then re-execute JWTenizr
- Add additional claims to: `jwt-token.json`

Note: The iss in `jwt-token.json` has to correspond with the `mp.jwt.verify.issuer` in `microprofile-config.properties`

## run from anywhere

A a shell script:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)
java -jar ${BASEDIR}/jwtenizr.jar "$@"%
```

will install JWTenizr "globally". Now you can launch JWTenizr from any directory you like
